                                                        3.1 Additional Information. As part of the creation of a paid event or at any time following such creation, you may be required by Ercess Inc to provide additional information (beyond the information required to register for the Services) about yourself, the entity you represent (if any) and the principals/beneficial owners of the entity you represent (if any) (collectively, "Additional Registration Data"). As an example, the Additional Registration Data may include current address, doing business as (DBA) names, description of products, website address, bank account or other payment account information, Tax Identification Numbers, date of birth, passport or drivers license number, country of origin, copies of government identification documents and other personal information. This information may be used to verify your identity, the validity and/or legality of your transactions and/or whether you qualify to use the Services for paid events. You agree to: (a) provide this information in a timely, accurate and complete manner and (b) maintain and promptly update this information in a timely manner to ensure it remains accurate and complete at all times.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        3.2 Disclosure Authorization.

In addition, you authorize Ercess Inc to verify your Registration Data and Additional Registration Data and conduct due diligence on you through third parties, including third party credit reporting agencies.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        3.3 Failure to Provide.

                                                                "Ercess Inc Payment Processing," "EPP," or the "EPP Service," in which Ercess Inc acts as Organizer's limited payments agent for the purpose of processing Event Registration Fees using its Payment Processing Partners (as defined below).

                                                            <p>
                                                                For the avoidance of doubt, Ercess Inc does not and will not provide banking, deposit taking, stored value, or any other financial services to an Organizer other than, for Organizers who elect EPP, serving as a limited payments agent as set forth below. To provide the EPP Service, Ercess Inc utilizes third party gateways, payment processors, merchant acquirers and/or merchant acquiring banks with which we have relationships (collectively, "Payment Processing Partners") and both Organizers and Ercess Inc are subject to the rules and regulations of such Payment Processing Partners. Additionally, in certain instances, for you to participate in the EPP Service, you must have entered into a separate agreement with our Payment Processing Partner (the &ldquo;Payment Processor Agreement&rdquo;). For convenience, Ercess Inc shows you a balance of proceeds for your events in your Ercess Inc account, by our Payment Processing Partners, and in the case of EPP, represents only a general unsecured claim against Ercess Inc and not a store of value or a deposit/current account.

                                                                Upon an order being placed by a Consumer and confirmed through Ercess Inc, Ercess Inc generates a confirmation message and issues a unique confirmation number for such Consumer's order. Organizer agrees to unconditionally accept, honor and fulfill all ticketing, registration, merchandise and donation commitments that have been confirmed by Ercess Inc through the Services. Organizer agrees it is Organizer's responsibility to verify a Consumer's confirmation number and/or any event restrictions prior to the applicable event.

                                                                Regardless of the payment processing option elected, Organizer agrees to pay Ercess Inc all applicable service fees for each ticket, registration or other item sold or donation solicited via the Services (the "Ercess Inc Service Fee"). To the extent Organizer uses EPP, Organizer also agrees to pay Ercess Inc the additional Ercess Inc Payment Processing fee (the "Ercess Inc Payment Processing Fee") for each ticket, registration or other item sold or donation solicited via the Services. The Ercess Inc Service Fee will be 1.5% on every ticket on which the organizer charges from the consumer. Note that these fees are subject to change from time to time with respect to transactions that occur following the change. In addition, Organizer may from time to time request additional Services from Ercess Inc, including without limitation marketing and promotion services, stall space services, which Ercess Inc may provide as per the packages opted by the organizer. Fees for such ancillary Services (the "Ancillary Fees") will be disclosed to Organizer prior to Organizer's acceptance of such Services. The Ercess Inc Service Fee, the Ercess Inc Payment Processing Fee and the Ancillary Fees are referred to herein as the "Fees." In addition to such Fees, Ercess Inc may also charge you, at Ercess Inc's standard rates, for research, including, but not limited to, (i) research required to respond to any third party or government subpoena, levy or garnishment on your account, and (2) research and activities necessary to verify and execute any payee change, whether pursuant to the government&rsquo;s direction or court order.

We have sole discretion to set and assess such fees.

If you are not qualified to use EPP, but you are otherwise qualified to use the Services, Ercess Inc will notify you and you may switch to EPP unless the reason that you do not qualify for EPP is that your event is a Prohibited Event, you are a Prohibited Merchant and/or your transactions are Prohibited Transactions, in each case as such terms are defined in Section 5 of this Merchant Agreement. For risk management and security reasons and to meet the requirements imposed by our Payment Processing Partners, we may from time to time in our discretion impose a transaction limit on the amount of any given transaction that you process through EPP and you authorize us to reject any transaction over that limit. We may also from time to time in our discretion impose a reserve requirement on you under Section 4.3(f).

Such payouts will be made only to the payout information designated by Organizer on the Services under "Payment Options." Payouts are made in INR only, by online transfer to bank account details shared by the organizer. In addition, EPP may allow you to accept payments from card based payment networks, such as Visa&reg;, MasterCard&reg;, or any other card affiliated with Ercess (collectively, the "Card Schemes"). Except to the extent that the Commercial Entity Agreement (as defined below) is applicable to you, and notwithstanding the Payment Processor Agreement you may have entered into with our Payment Processing Partner, or a Card Scheme, you are not a direct party to any agreement with any Payment Processing Partner, Card Scheme or Alternative Form of Payment Framework, nor are you a third party beneficiary of any such agreement. In addition, by accepting a particular Card Scheme payment type (e.g., MasterCard, Visa), you are authorizing the owner of that Card Scheme and its affiliates to use your name, address and website URL in any media from time to time.

                                                                With respect to any events for which Organizer uses EPP, Organizer hereby appoints Ercess Inc as Organizer's limited payment agent for the purpose of facilitating the receipt of payments made by Consumers for such events through our Payment Processing Partners, and the disbursement of those payments to Organizer. Organizer agrees that a payment made by a Consumer that is processed by Ercess Inc will be considered the same as a payment made by a Consumer directly to Organizer and Organizer will sell or provide all advertised goods and services to the Consumer as if Organizer had directly received the Event Registration Fees from such Consumer, regardless of whether the Event Registration Fees have yet to be or are ever received from Ercess Inc. Organizer agrees that Ercess Inc, in its role as limited payments agent, is authorized to (i) enable Consumers to transfer or upgrade a ticket and/or registration (if such transfers are permitted by Organizer during the event registration process); (ii) hold, disburse and retain proceeds on Organizer's behalf pursuant to this Merchant Agreement, or otherwise instruct our Payment Processing Partners to do so; (iii) issue refunds to Consumers as set forth in Section 4.4 below; and (iv) manage credit card chargebacks as set forth in subsection (g) below. In accepting appointment as the limited agent of Organizer, Ercess Inc assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of Organizer and Organizer understands that Ercess Inc's obligation to pay Organizer is subject to and conditional upon Consumers&rsquo; actual payment of Event Registration Fees. Organizer further authorizes Ercess Inc to delegate its obligations under this Merchant Agreement to certain of its affiliated entities both within and outside India, provided, that Ercess Inc will remain liable for the discharge of its obligations under this Merchant Agreement by such affiliated entities.

                                                                Organizer agrees that all Event Registration Fees for a given event are earned by Organizer only following the conclusion of the applicable event. Ercess Inc, in its discretion, may determine to advance a portion of Event Registration Fees to Organizer prior five (5) business days after the successful completion of an event, on such terms and conditions set forth in (i) this Merchant Agreement; (ii) the applicable agreement for Services entered into by you and Ercess Inc; and/or (iii) such terms that Organizer and Ercess Inc agree to in a separate agreement. Organizer agrees that any payments made by Ercess Inc of Event Registration Fees prior to the fifth (5th) business day after the end date of the successful completion of the applicable event are merely advances of amounts that may become due to Organizer under this Merchant Agreement. If Ercess Inc decides to advance a portion of Event Registration Fees to Organizer, Organizer acknowledges and agrees that Ercess Inc may at any time (x) terminate or suspend Organizer's right to receive such advance payments; and/or (y) alter the terms (i.e. frequency, reserve rate and maximum aggregate cap) of such advance payments made to Organizer. In addition, Organizer agrees that Ercess Inc may demand back such advances (or any portion thereof) from time to time in its discretion based upon the level of refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks, customer complaints, allegations of fraud, changes in Organizer's credit profile or the underlying event(s)' risk profile, or breaches of the Terms of Service, including this Merchant Agreement. Upon receipt of notice of any such demand, Organizer will thereupon promptly pay back to Ercess Inc the portion of any such advance demanded. Organizer acknowledges and agrees that Ercess Inc has the right to withhold funds as set forth in Sections 4.3(b) and 4.5(a) of this Merchant Agreement. Organizer also acknowledges and accepts its obligations under Section 4.3(g) and 4.4(c) of the Merchant Agreement, including its obligations to reimburse Ercess Inc for refunds and credit card chargebacks.

                                                                No payments will be made to Organizer with respect to any event that is cancelled or with respect to which Ercess Inc believes there is a risk of cancellation or nonperformance, unless Ercess Inc receives adequate security (as determined by Ercess Inc in its discretion) for Organizer's obligations under this Merchant Agreement. In addition, no Event Registration Fees for a given event will be settled to Organizer until that event is successfully completed. If payments have already been settled to an Organizer for a cancelled event, Organizer will immediately refund to a payment address designated by Ercess Inc all such payments upon cancellation of such event for the purpose of effecting refunds if refunds are being made under Section 4.4. You are responsible for complying with the requirements of Section 4.4 and the requirements of the Organizer Refund Policy Requirements which are in addition to and are incorporated into the Terms of Service by reference. If you do not remit funds due to Ercess Inc that are sufficient to cover refunds due to Consumers for an event cancellation or nonperformance, including, but not limited to, any mandatory refunds under Section 4.4(c) below, then you acknowledge and agree that the amount of such funds shortfall will become due and owing from you to us under these Terms of Service, including this Merchant Agreement, until you have satisfied the amount in full and such amounts are also subject to the provisions of Sections 4.4(f) and 4.5 of this Agreement.

                                                                Ercess Inc reserves the right to retain a certain percentage of Event Registration Fees and any other fees for Services provided to you or any of your Affiliates by Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates (with such percentage being determined by Ercess Inc in its discretion) to fund a reserve (i) at any time as we determine in our discretion to be necessary based upon the level (or expected level) of refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks, customer complaints, allegations of fraud or changes in Organizer's credit profile or the underlying event(s)' risk profile; and (ii) as otherwise necessary to secure the performance of your obligations under the Terms of Service, including this Merchant Agreement, or to protect Ercess Inc against fraudulent or erroneous activity. Ercess Inc's right to hold a reserve will continue following the applicable event(s) and until either (A) Organizer and any of its Affiliates have discharged all obligations under the Terms of Service or other applicable agreement for Services provided by Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates and the applicable periods for refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks, and complaints have passed or (B) Organizer and any of its Affiliates have otherwise provided Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates with adequate security (as determined by Ercess Inc or its Affiliates in their discretion) for its obligations under the Terms of Service or other applicable agreement for Services provided by Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates, whether matured or unmatured, contingent or non-contingent, or liquidated or unliquidated. Further, the reserve is subject to the right of setoff as set forth in Section 4.3(b). In the event that the exercise of our or our Affiliates' setoff right does not fully cover the amount of funds due and owing from you or any of your Affiliates to us or any of our Affiliates under the Terms of Service or other applicable agreement for Services provided by Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates, including this Merchant Agreement, then such amount of funds will be deemed due and owing to us until you have satisfied the amount in full.

As part of Ercess Inc's activity as limited payments agent, Ercess Inc will use commercially reasonable efforts to manage the re-presentment of such chargebacks and reversals on behalf of Organizer and Organizer hereby authorizes Ercess Inc to do so and agrees to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Ercess Inc in such re-presentment. However, Ercess Inc will have no obligation to re-present any chargeback that it believes in its discretion it is more likely than not to lose or that relates to a transaction that should be refunded in accordance with the Organizer's refund policy or the provisions of Section 4.4(c) below. Understanding the nature of the Payment Scheme Rules (as defined below) and the discretion that they provide to the Card Schemes and Alternative Form of Payment Frameworks, both parties agree that Ercess Inc's loss of any chargeback that has been re-presented by Ercess Inc will not in any way limit Organizer's obligation to reimburse Ercess Inc and its affiliates under this paragraph.

In addition, Event Registration Fees collected in a currency may only be paid out to Organizer in the currency in which they are collected. Ercess Inc does not provide currency conversion services. Finally different payment options or payment methods may be available to you depending on the currency in which you collect Event Registration Fees and your location.

The Organizer Refund Policy Requirements are incorporated by reference into this Merchant Agreement. All refunds for EPP transactions must be processed through Ercess Inc, unless otherwise agreed by Ercess Inc. For EPP transactions, Organizer can issue refunds to Consumers directly through the Services within certain windows permitted by our Payment Processing Partners. If the refund is outside such windows, then it will need to be processed manually by Ercess Inc. Ercess Inc may determine in its discretion not to process any refunds which are manual, in which case they will be processed directly by Organizer. Consistent with the Consumer Refund Policy Requirements, refunds that you are responsible for due to the cancellation or nonperformance of an event are subject to the following refund requirements:

                                                                    </p>

                                                                    </p>

                                                                    </p>

                                                                        Organizer acknowledges that Ercess Inc reserves the right to charge the Organizer for the cost of charge backs related to the cancelled event, and such amounts are also subject to the provisions of Sections 4.4(f) and 4.5 of this Agreement.
                                                                    </p>

                                                                    <p>
                                                                        If the Organizer cancels only part of a multi-day event, then Organizer agrees to refund a pro-rata monetary value portion of the purchase price of a multi-day ticket based on the corresponding monetary value of the portion of the multi-day event that was cancelled. For example, if Organizer sells a 3-day ticket to a festival for Rs 3,000/-, and cancels 1 day of the festival, the Organizer must provide a Rs 1,000/- refund to Consumers for the cancelled day.
                                                                    </p>

                                                                <li>
                                                                    <p>
                                                                        If the Organizer is offering Consumers an "other make good" refund in lieu of purchase price refund, then such offer must be of equal or greater value to the value of the ticket for the cancelled event and such value must be clearly communicated to the Consumers. Organizer agrees that it will be fully liable for the cost of chargebacks received related to purchases even if an "other make good" refund is given. 
                                                                    </p>

                                                                Regardless of what payment method is selected, all disputes regarding refunds are between Organizer and its Consumers. In the event of a dispute, Ercess Inc may try to mediate, but ultimately it is Organizer's obligation to settle the dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to EPP transactions, Ercess Inc will have the right to make refunds on Organizer's behalf as set forth in subsection (c) below.
                                                            </p>

                                                            <p>
                                                                Notwithstanding the foregoing, Organizer authorizes Ercess Inc to make refunds in the following situations (i) Organizer specifically authorizes the refunds at the time; (ii) the event description presented to a Consumer at time of purchase is significantly different from the actual event; (iii) Attendees are unable to attend the event due to failure of the Organizer to adequately plan for capacity, ingress or egress, or attendance will otherwise subject the Consumer to safety concerns; (iv) Ercess Inc believes in its discretion that specific orders should be refunded under the Organizer's posted refund policy or Ercess Inc's Organizer Refund Policy Requirements, including without limitation, that they are required by applicable local, state, provincial, national or other law, rule or regulation or the Payment Scheme Rules; (v) Ercess Inc believes in its discretion that the refund request, if not granted, will lead to a chargeback that Ercess Inc is more likely than not to lose; (vi) Organizer failed to list a refund policy on the applicable event page and Ercess Inc believes in its discretion that a refund would be reasonable under the circumstances; (vii) Ercess Inc believes in its discretion that specific orders are fraudulent (e.g., made with stolen credit cards or otherwise not bona fide transactions); or (viii) Ercess Inc believes in its discretion that the order is a duplicate. Organizer also authorizes Ercess Inc to make refunds of any and all orders (including those for unrelated events) if (A) Ercess Inc believes in its discretion that Organizer has engaged in any fraudulent activity or made any misrepresentations; (B) Ercess Inc believes in its discretion that there is substantial risk of nonperformance by Organizer with respect to the applicable event or future events; (C) Ercess Inc believes in its discretion that it is likely to receive complaints, refund requests, transaction reversals and/or chargebacks with respect to a substantial amount of orders; or (D) Ercess Inc believes in its discretion that Organizer is a Prohibited Merchant, has used the Services to process Prohibited Transactions or to manage Prohibited Events or that failing to make the refunds would otherwise expose Ercess Inc to legal liability. Because all sales are ultimately made by Organizers, Organizer hereby agrees to promptly and fully reimburse Ercess Inc and its affiliates upon demand for refunds that Ercess Inc makes pursuant to this Merchant Agreement, other than to the extent that the necessity for such refunds is caused by Ercess Inc's negligence or willful misconduct. Organizer acknowledges and agrees that chargebacks will result in losses to Ercess Inc in excess of the amount of the underlying transaction and that by refunding transactions in advance of a chargeback Ercess Inc is mitigating such losses and its damages with respect to Organizer's breach of this Merchant Agreement. If you do not remit funds to Ercess Inc that are sufficient to cover mandatory refunds as described by this Section 4.4(c) for an event cancellation or nonperformance, then you acknowledge and agree that the amount of such funds shortfall will become due and owing from you to us under the Terms of Service, including this Merchant Agreement, until you have satisfied the amount in full and such amounts are also subject to the provisions of Sections 4.4(f) and 4.4 of this Agreement.

In the event any amounts are owed by Organizer or any of its Affiliates to Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates under the Terms of Service (including without limitation this Merchant Agreement) or any or other applicable agreement for Services provided by Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates, Ercess Inc or its Affiliates may, without limiting its other rights and remedies and to the extent permitted by applicable local, state, provincial, national or other laws, rules or regulations (A) withhold any amounts due to Organizer or any of Organizer's Affiliates, whether for a particular event or for any other event that Organizer or any of Organizer's Affiliates lists through the Services or other applicable agreement for Services provided by Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates, and use the withheld amount to setoff the amount owed by Organizer or any of Organizer's Affiliates to Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates; and/or (B) send an invoice to Organizer or any of its Affiliates for such amounts to the extent Organizer's or any of its Affiliate's outstanding balance is insufficient to cover these costs, in which case Organizer or any of its Affiliates will pay Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates such invoiced amounts within thirty (30) days after the date of the invoice. If payment for any amounts due to Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates hereunder is not made by Organizer or any of its Affiliates when due and after receiving a late payment notice from Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates, Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates reserves the right, in its discretion and without limiting its other rights and remedies, to suspend or terminate Organizer's or any of Organizer's Affiliate's registration for any Services provided by Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates (including any and all accounts that Organizer or any of Organizer's Affiliates may have). In addition, any such unpaid amounts due and owing to Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates are subject to collections in accordance with Section 4.5(b).

In addition, Organizer agrees to promptly and fully reimburse Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates upon demand for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred by Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates in collecting past due amounts or any other amounts due and owing from Organizer or any of its Affiliates under this Merchant Agreement, the Terms of Service or any or other applicable agreement for Services provided by Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates. Organizer and any of its Affiliates agree that if Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates must seek collections for past due amounts and Organizer or any of its Affiliates does not respond or pay in full after receiving a collection notice, Ercess Inc or any of its Affiliates reserves the right to pursue outstanding balances through judicial proceedings, and such actions are expressly excluded from any arbitration provisions set forth in the Terms of Service.
